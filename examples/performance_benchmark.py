"""Performance benchmark for Minitensor.

This script compares the execution time of a matrix multiplication operation
against PyTorch and TensorFlow when those libraries are available. The script is
safe to run even if the optional dependencies are missing; in that case the
corresponding benchmarks are skipped.
