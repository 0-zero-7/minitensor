Neural network modules and layers for Minitensor.

This module provides building blocks for creating neural networks including
layers, activation functions, and utilities. The heavy lifting is implemented
in Rust and exposed through PyO3 bindings.

The original implementation assumed that every piece of functionality was
always present in the compiled extension.  The stripped down test environment
ships a minimal core where many of these components are missing which caused
importing :mod:`minitensor` to fail with ``AttributeError``.  To make the Python
API robust we now populate the namespace dynamically â€“ only symbols that exist
in the core are exported.  This mirrors the behaviour of optional components in
other numerical libraries and allows parts of the library (such as the tensor
API) to be used independently of the neural network layers.
